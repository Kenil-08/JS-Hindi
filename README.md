# Mini Projects Repository

This GitHub repository contains four mini projects to showcase simple web applications. Each project is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in web development and JavaScript programming.

## 1. BMI Calculator

The BMI Calculator is a straightforward application that allows users to input their weight and height to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) index. It provides a quick way to assess whether an individual's weight is within a healthy range.

### Usage:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter your weight and height.
3. Click the "Calculate BMI" button.
4. View the calculated BMI index.

## 2. Color Switcher

The Color Switcher is a fun project that features four buttons, each changing the background color of the webpage. It provides a simple example of how JavaScript can manipulate the appearance of a webpage dynamically.

### Usage:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click on any of the five or six buttons to change the background color.

## 3. Digital Clock

The Digital Clock project displays the local time in a standard hour-minute-second format. It serves as a basic example of creating a dynamic element on a webpage that updates in real-time.

### Usage:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the digital clock displaying the current local time.

## 4. Guess the Number

The Guess the Number game challenges users to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100 within 10 attempts. It demonstrates the use of random number generation and user input handling in JavaScript.

### Usage:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Submit" button.
3. Continue guessing until you either correctly identify the number or exhaust your 10 attempts.

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from these mini projects. Each project is contained in its respective HTML file and includes associated JavaScript and CSS for functionality and styling. Happy coding!
